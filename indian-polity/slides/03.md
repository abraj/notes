#### Parliamentary vs Presidential system

| Parliamentary system | Presidential system |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| executive part of legislature | executive and legislature are clearly separated |
| President is head of state; PM is head of govt | President is head of state as well as head of govt |
| President is the nominal head of state; COM (headed by PM) is true executive | President has real exec powers |
| Ministers are from parliament (max 6 months to acquire membership) | Ministers are not from parliament
| COM responsible to popular house (LS) | President and his team not responsible to legislature; Impeachment by legislature possible but practically very difficult |
| stress on accountability of executive; stability of executive is less | stress on stability of executive; less accountability of executive towards legislature |

#### Separation of Power
* idea given by French philosopher Montesquieu
* three organs of govt (Legislature, Executive and Judiciary) separated into water-tight compartments
* aim of preventing the state from becoming totalitarian (authoritarian)
* USA was the first country to implement this idea
* India:
    - the idea is incorporated as concept of 'Checks and Balances' (part of 'Basic Structure' of constitution)
    - Checks and Balances => Separation of Power
    - In Parliamentary system, there can't be pure separation of power (Executive $\subset$ Legislature)
