#### Written vs Unwritten constitution

| Written constitution | Unwritten constitution |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Articles and provisions codified into a single legal document | No such single legal document; Constitution is simply list of laws passed by Legislature |
| Created on a particular date | Evolved over a period of time |
| Constitution is supreme | Legislature (Parliament) is supreme |
| Judiciary enjoys wide powers; Judicial review possible | Judiciary has limited powers; Judicial review not possible |
| Distinction between constitution and other laws | All laws (enactments of Parliament) become part of constitution |
| can give rise to Federal or Unitary govt | can give rise to Unitary govt only |
| can be flexible (as in Sri Lanka) or rigid (as in USA) or a mix of both (as in India) | always flexible (making new law => amendment of constitution) |
| Eg. USA, India, Sri Lanka | Eg. UK, Israel, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia |

#### Federalism vs Unitary Government

| Federalism | Unitary Govt |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Power divided between centre and states (both are superior in their respective areas) | All power lies with centre (opp. of Federalism) |
| - | state governments do exist (only act as administrative arms of centre) |
| there must be a written constitution | there can be a written or unwritten constitution |
| the constitution must be supreme and rigid (can't be changed by centre or states alone) | - |
| Independent judiciary (SC) as arbitrator of any dispute between centre and states over division of power | Judiciary not that powerful |
| Eg. USA, Canada, Australia, Russia | Eg. UK, France, Japan, China |

India is neither Federal nor Unitary, but a _'Union of States'_
