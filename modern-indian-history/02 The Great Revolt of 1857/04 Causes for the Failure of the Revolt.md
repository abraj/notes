#### Causes for the Failure of the Revolt

* The whole of India not united in the revolt
    - different sections of society such as moneylenders, merchants and modern educated Indians were actually against the Revolt

* Far superior resources of the British Empire
    - possessed better equipment
    - aided by new scientific inventions such as the telegraph system and postal communications
    - this enabled the British to keep in touch with all parts of the country and to manoeuvre their troops according to their needs

* Lack of organisation among insurgents
    - lack of a carefully concerted general plan
    - lack of a strong central organisation to plan the movements of the army and oversee their strategy
