The period from 1905 was known as the era of extremism in the Indian National Movement. The extremists or the aggressive nationalists believed that success could be achieved through bold means.

#### Causes for the Rise of Extremism
* The failure of the Moderates to win any notable success other than the expansion of the legislative councils by the Indian Councils Act (1892).
* The famine and plague of 1896-97 which affected the whole country and the suffering of the masses.
* The economic conditions of the people became worse.
* The racial discrimination of Indians in South Africa
* The Russo-Japanese war of 1904-5 in which Japan, an Asian country, defeated the European power Russia.

___The immediate cause for the rise of extremism___  
Reactionary rule of Lord Curzon:
* He passed the Calcutta Corporation Act, (1899) reducing the Indian control of this local body.
* The Universities Act (1904) reduced the elected members in the University bodies. It also reduced the autonomy of the universities and made them government departments.
* The Sedition Act and the Official Secrets Act reduced the freedoms of all people.
* His worst measure was the Partition of Bengal (1905).

#### Main Objective of Extremists
Their main objective was to attain Swaraj or complete independence and not just self-government.

#### Methods of the Extremists
The Extremists had no faith in the British sense of justice and fair play. They believed that political rights will have to be fought for.

The methods used by the extremists were:
* Not cooperating with the British Government by boycotting government courts, schools and colleges.
* Promotion of Swadeshi and boycott of foreign goods.
* Introduction and promotion of national education.

#### Partition of Bengal and the Rise of Extremism
Curzon’s real motives behind the partition of Bengal in 1905 were:
* To break the growing strength of Bengali nationalism since Bengal was the base of Indian nationalism.
* To divide the Hindus and Muslims in Bengal.
* To show the enormous power of the British Government in doing whatever it liked.

Public response:
* the people of Bengal orgainsed protest meetings and observed a day of mourning.
* The whole political life of Bengal underwent a change.
* The anti-partition movement culminated into the Swadeshi Movement and spread to other parts of India.

INC Response:
* The aggressive nationalists forced Dadabhai Naoroji to speak of Swaraj (which was not a Moderate demand) in the Calcutta Session of Congress in 1906.
* They adopted the resolutions of Boycott and Swadeshi.
* The Moderate Congressmen were unhappy. They wanted Swaraj to be achieved through constitutional methods.

Surat Split:
* The differences led to a split in the Congress at the Surat session in 1907.
* The extremists came out of the Congress led by Tilak and others.

#### Swadeshi Movement (1905)
* It was both a political and economic movement.
* It involved programmes like:
    - the boycott of government service, courts, schools and colleges and
    - the boycott of foreign goods, promotion of Swadeshi goods,
    - promotion of National Education through the establishment of national schools and colleges

___British response:___
* The government passed several Acts to crush the movement.
* The Swadeshi volunteers were beaten badly.

* Some Indian government employees lost their jobs.
