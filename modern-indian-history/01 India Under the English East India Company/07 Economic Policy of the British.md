### Revenue Administration and Economic Policy of the British

Till the 18th century, there was a strong relation between agriculture and cottage industries in India.

India was not only ahead in the field of agriculture than most other countries but it also held a prominent place in the world in the field of handicraft production.

_The British exploitation:_
* The British destroyed handicraft industry in the country
* The British unleashed far-reaching changes in the country’s agrarian structure by introducing new systems of land tenures and policies of revenue administration.
    - The British policies revolved around getting maximum income from land without caring much about Indian interests of the cultivators.
    - They abandoned the age-old system of revenue administration and adopted in their place a ruthless policy of revenue collection.

The British principally adopted three types of land tenures (revenue system):
1. Permanent Settlement or Zamindari System
    - introduced in Bengal, Bihar, Banaras, division of the Northern Western Provinces and northern Karnatak
    - covered roughly 19 per cent of the total area under the British rule
2. Mahalwari Settlement
    - introduced in major parts of the North Western Provinces, Central Provinces and the Punjab with some variations
    - covered about 30 per cent of the total area under British rule
3. Ryotwari System
    - introduced in part of the Bombay and Madras Presidencies, Assam and certain other parts of British India
    - covered about 51 per cent of the area under British rule

#### The Permanent Settlement

It is appropriate to recall that Warren Hastings introduced the annual lease system of auctioning the land to the highest bidder. It created chaos in the revenue administration.

Lord Cornwallis decided to abolish the annual lease system and introduce a decennial (Ten years) settlement which was subsequently declared to be continuous.

* The Permanent Land Revenue Settlement of Bengal was introduced by Lord Cornwallis in 1793.
* Later, it was extended to the provinces of Bihar and Orissa in the same year.
* The system eventually spread all over northern India by a series of regulations dated 1 May 1793.

Main features of the Permanent Settlement:
* The zamindars of Bengal were recognised as the owners of land as long as they paid the revenue to the East India Company regularly.
    - The amount of revenue that the zamindars had to pay to the Company was firmly fixed and would not be raised under any circumstances.
    - The Government of the East India Company got 89% leaving the rest to the zamindars.
* The ryots became tenants since they were considered the tillers of the soil.
* This settlement took away the administrative and judicial functions of the zamindars.

Problems of the Permanent Settlement:
* The Permanent Settlement of Cornwallis was bitterly criticised on the point that it was adopted with ‘undue haste’.
* There was no attempt was made ever either to survey the lands or to assess their value. The assessment was made roughly on the basis of accounts of previous collections and it was done in an irregular manner.
* The effects of this system both on the zamindars and ryots were disastrous. As the revenue fixed by the system was too high, many zamindars defaulted on payments. Their property was seized and distress sales were conducted leading to their ruin.
* The rich zamindars who led luxurious lives left their villages and migrated into towns. They entrusted their rent collection to agents who exacted all kinds of illegal taxes besides the legal ones from the ryots. This had resulted in a great deal of misery amongst the peasants and farmers.

Therefore Lord Cornwallis’ idea of building a system of benevolent land-lordism failed. Though initially the Company gained financially, in the long run the Company suffered financial loss because land productivity was high, income from it was meagre since it was a fixed sum. It should be noted that in pre- British period a share on the crop was fixed as land tax.

Nevertheless, this system proved to be a great boon to the zamindars and to the government of Bengal.
* It formed a regular income and stabilised the government of the Company.
* The zamindars prospered at the cost of the welfare of the tenants.

#### Ryotwari Settlement
* Sir Thomas Munro introduced this system in the Madras Presidency in 1820.
* It was introduced mainly in Madras, Berar, Bombay and Assam.

Main features of the Ryotwari Settlement:
* The peasant was recognised as the proprietor of land. There was no intermediary like a Zamindar between the peasant and the government. So long as he paid the revenue in time, the peasant was not evicted from the land.
* The land revenue was fixed for a period from 20 to 40 years at a time.
* Every peasant was held personally responsible for direct payment of land revenue to the government


However, in the end, this system also failed since:
* Under this settlement it was certainly not possible to collect revenue in a systematic manner.
* The revenue officials indulged in harsh mesuares for non payment or delayed payment.

#### Mahalwari Settlement
* In 1833, the Mahalwari settlement was introduced in the Punjab, the Central Provinces and parts of North Western Provinces.
* Under this system the basic unit of revenue settlement was the village or the Mahal.
* As the village lands belonged jointly to the village community, the responsibility of paying the revenue rested with the entire Mahal or the village community.

Though the Mahalwari system eliminated middlemen between the government and the village community, yet its benefit was largely enjoyed by the government.

#### British Policy towards Indian Handicrafts

India was already far ahead of other countries in the world. State of the Indian industries before the 18th century:

* Textile industry
    - The textiles were the most important among the Indian industries.
    - India's cotton, silk and woolen products were sought after all over the world.
    - Particularly, the muslin of Dacca, carpets of Lahore, shawls of Kashmir, and the embroidery works of Banaras were very famous.
* Traditional handicraft industry
    - Ivory goods, wood works and jewellery were other widely sought after Indian commodities.
    - Cutting and polishing of marble and other precious stones and carving of ivory and sandalwood were very famous.
    - Gold, silver and diamond jewellery was an important industrial activity.
* Metal industry
    - Moradabad and Banaras were famous for brass, copper, bronze utensils.
    - Nasik, Poona, Hyderabad and Tanjore were famous for other metal works.
* Kolhapur, Satara, Gorakhpur, Agra, Chittor and Palaghat had likewise earned a reputation for their glass industries.
* Kutch, Sind and Punjab were known for manufacturing arms.

Despite enjoying such fame in the world, the Indian handicraft industry had begun to decline by the beginning of the 18th century.

_Reasons for the decline of the Indian handicraft industry:_

* The policies followed by the English East India Company
    - The Indian market was flooded with the cheap finished goods from Britain. It resulted in a steep decline in the sale of Indian products both within and outside of the country.
    - In 1769, the Company encouraged the cultivation of raw silk in Bengal while imposing service restrictions on the sale of its finished products.
    - The tariff and control policies were suitably modified to suit the British commercial interests. For example, very low British duty was imposed on the import of British manufactured cotton cloth. Whereas a very high export duty was charged on Indian cotton textiles.
    - As a result of all these policies, the Indian textiles could not enter the British market, whereas the Indian market was flooded with British goods.
* Reduction of demand for the domestic luxury goods
    - With the rise of British paramountcy in India, the process of decline in the power and status of Indian rulers had set in.
    - Thus, with the disappearance of the traditional dynasties, their nobility also faded away.
    - This led to a sharp decline in the demand for traditional luxury goods like royal attires, armory and objects of art.
* The Industrial revolution
    - The Industrial revolution led to the invention of new machinery in Europe. Power looms replaced handlooms.
    - In India also the advent of machines led to the decline of handicraft as now the machine-made products were available at cheaper rate and more goods could be produced in much lesser time.
* Advent of the new communication and transport facilities
    - The new communication and transport facilities brought about a revolution in public life.
    - Earlier, goods used to be transported either by bullock carts or by ships. With the introduction of railways and steamer services, the normal transportation carried on even in the rainy season.
    - Concrete roads were laid to connect the country’s agricultural remote areas.

The import of goods from England also increased with the simultaneous increase in exports of raw materials from India, leading to massive loss of jobs among Indian artisans and craftsman who lost their only means to livelihood.
