## Lord Hastings (1813-1823)
* adopted a vigorous forward policy and waged wars extensively
* He further expanded the British power in India.

_Prevalent conditions in India:_
* There was anarchy in central India. The Pindaris plundered the whole region and the Marathas could not control them.
* Also, there was infighting among the Maratha chiefs.
* Hastings was also troubled by the expansion of the Gurkha power.

### War against the Gurkhas (1814-16)
* Nepal emerged as a powerful Gurkha state in 1768.
* The aggressions of the Gurkhas into the British territories culminated in a war.
* In 1814 several battles were fought between the British and the Gurkhas. Amar Singh Thapa, the able General of Nepal Army was forced to surrender.
* In March 1816, the __Treaty of Sagauli__ was concluded.
    - The Gurkhas gave up their claim over the Tarai region and ceded the areas of Kumaon and Garhwal to the British.
    - The British now secured the area around Simla and their north-western borders touched the Himalayas.
    - The Gurkhas had to withdraw from Sikkim and they also agreed to keep a British Resident at Katmandu.
    - It was also agreed that the kingdom of Nepal would not employ any other foreigner in its services other than the English.
    - The British had also obtained the sites of hill stations like Simla, Mussoori, Nainital, Ranikhet and developed them as tourist and health resorts.

After this victory in the Gurkha War Hastings was honoured with English peerage and he became Marquis of Hastings.

### Suppression of the Pindaris

_Pindaris:_
* They did not belong to any particular caste or creed. Their leaders belonged to both the Hindu as well as the Muslim communities.
* They used to serve the army without any payment but instead were allowed to plunder.
* They were mostly active in the areas of Rajputana and the Central Provinces and subsisted on plunder.
* It is worth mentioning here that they never helped the British.

_Suppressive action of Lord Hastings:_
* Lord Hastings was determined to suppress the Pindaris.
* He gathered a large army and attacked the Pindaris from four sides.
* By 1818, the Pindaris were completely suppressed and all their bands disintegrated.
* By 1824, all their leaders were killed or captured. Thus, the menace of the Pindaris came to an end.

### Downfall of the Maratha Confederacy
* The Maratha power had weakened considerably after the Third
* Battle of Panipat (1761) and the two subsequent wars against the British.
* The Maratha chiefs fought amongst themselves and their successors were invariably weak and incapable.
* The relationships of powerful Maratha chiefs like the Bhonsle, Gaekwar, Scindia, Holkar and the Peshwa were ridden with mutual jealousies.

The Bhonsle chief, Appa Sahib signed the __Treaty of Nagpur__ with the British on 17 May 1816. According to this treaty, Nagpur came under the control of the Company.

_Peshwa Baji Rao II:_
* wanted to become the head of the Maratha Confederacy and at the same time wanted freedom from the British control
* Murder of Gaekwar Prime Minister Gangadhar Shastri on his way back after a negotiation with Peshwa caused a lot of anger not only among the Marathas but also among the British.
* The British Resident Elphinstone forced the Peshwa to sign the __Treaty of Poona__ on 13 June 1817.
* Baji Rao gave up his desire to become the supreme head of the Marathas.

### Third Maratha War (1817-1819)
_Peshwa and Holkar:_
* The Peshwa undid the Treaty of Poona with the British and on 5 November 1817 attacked the British Residency.
* The Peshwa was defeated at a place called Kirkee.
* Peshwa turned to Holkar for help, but Holkar too was defeated by the British on 21 December 1817 at Baroda.

_Bhonsle:_
* Similarly, the Bhonsle chief, Appa Sahib also refused to abide by the Treaty of Nagpur.
* He fought with the British in the Battle of Sitabaldi in November 1817, but was defeated.

_Scindia:_
* In 1818, Scindia was also forced to sign a new treaty with the British on the basis of which Ajmer was given to the Nawab of Bhopal, who also accepted the British suzerainty.

_Gaekwar of Baroda:_
* accepted the Subsidiary Alliance, agreed to hand over certain areas of Ahmedabad to the British

The year 1818 was a significant year on account of major political achievements for the British. The Maratha dream of establishing themselves as the paramount power in India was completely destroyed. Thus, the last hurdle in the way of British paramountcy was removed.

### Causes of the Defeat of the Marathas
* The major drawback of the Maratha power was mutual bitterness and lack of cooperation amongst themselves.
* Lack of capable leadership
* Military weakness of the Marathas.
* The Marathas did not have cordial relations with other princes and Nawabs of India.
* The Marathas failed to estimate correctly the political and diplomatic strength of the British.

### Reforms of Hastings
* He approved the __Ryotwari system__ of land revenue introduced in the Madras Presidency by Sir Thomas Munroe.
* In the sphere of judiciary, the Cornwallis Code was improved.
* The Police system of Bengal was extended to other regions.
* Hastings had also encouraged the foundation of vernacular schools by missionaries and others.
    - In 1817, the Hindu College was established at Calcutta by the public for the teaching of English and western science.
* He encouraged the freedom of the Press and abolished the censorship introduced in 1799.
    - The Bengali Weekly, _'Samachar Darpan'_ was started in 1818 by Marshman, a Serampore missionary.

### Estimate
* Lord Hastings was an able soldier and a brilliant administrator.
* His liberal views on education and Press are commendable.
* He suppressed the Pindaris, defeated the Marathas and curbed the power of the Gurkhas.
* His territorial gains strengthened the British power in India. He was considered the maker of the Bombay Presidency.
* In short, he completed and consolidated the work of Wellesley.
