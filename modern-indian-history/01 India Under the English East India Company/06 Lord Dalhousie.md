## Lord Dalhousie (1848-1856)
* Lord Dalhousie was the youngest Governor-General of India when he assumed charge at the age of 36 in 1848.
* He did much for the progress of railway construction in England as the president of the Board of Trade.

### Policy of Annexation
* Although he used different reasons for annexation, his main objective was to end misrule in the annexed states, as in the case of the annexation of Oudh.
* His great annexations include the Punjab, Lower Burma, most of the Central Provinces and Oudh.
* He aimed at providing the beneficent administration to the people of the annexed states.
* At the same time he had in his mind the advantages of annexation to the British such as imperial defence, commercial and financial benefits.

### Annexation of Punjab (1849)
* Punjab was annexed by Dalhousie at the end of the second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849.
* He organized the administration of Punjab very efficiently.
* The overall administration of Punjab was entrusted to the Chief Commissioner. In fact, the Governor-General was the virtual ruler of Punjab.
* In 1859, Sir John Lawrence became the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab.

### Second Burmese War and the Annexation of Lower Burma (1852)
* After the end of the second Burmese War (1852), Dalhousie annexed Lower Burma with its capital at Pegu.
* The annexation of Lower Burma proved beneficial to Britain. Rangoon, Britain’s most valuable acquisition from the war became one of the biggest ports in Asia.

### Doctrine of Lapse
* Dalhousie also took advantage of every opportunity to acquire territory by peaceful means.
* The East India Company was rapidly becoming the predominant power in India. It had concluded alliances with Indian rulers.

_The principle of Doctrine of Lapse:_
* It was customary for a ruler without a natural heir to ask the British Government whether he could adopt a son to succeed him. According to Dalhousie, if such permission was refused by the British, the state would “lapse” and thereby become part of the British India.
* According to the Hindu Law, one can adopt a son in case of no male heir to inherit the property. Dalhousie maintained that there was a difference in principle between the right to inherit private property and the right to govern.

_Annexations using Doctrine of Lapse by Dalhousie:_
* Satara (1848)
* Jaitpur and Sambalpur (1849)
* Nagpur and Jhansi (1854)
* Tanjore and Arcot (1855)

As a result of annexation of Satara, Nagpur and Jhansi a large part of the Central Provinces came under the British rule.


* Although the Doctrine of Lapse cannot be regarded as illegal, its application by Dalhousie was disliked by Indian princes.
* After the Mutiny of 1857, the doctrine of lapse was withdrawn.

### Annexation of Oudh (1856)

_Background:_
* The British relations with the state of Oudh go back to the Treaty of Allahabad in 1765.
* Right from Warren Hastings, many Governor-Generals advised the Nawab of Oudh to improve the administration.
* But, misrule continued there and the Nawab was under the assumption that the British would not annex Oudh because of his loyalty to them.

Lord Dalhousie annexed Oudh in 1856 under the pretext of mis-governance. Dalhousie’s annexation of Oudh was the last one among his annexations.

_Implications:_
* The annexation created great political danger.
* The annexation offended the Muslim elite.
* More dangerous was the effect on the British army’s Indian troops, many of whom came from Oudh.
    - They had occupied a privileged position before its annexation.
    - Under the British Government they were treated as equals with the rest of the population.
    - This was a loss of prestige for them.

In these various ways, the annexation of Oudh contributed to the Mutiny of 1857.

### Domestic Reforms of Dalhousie
The appointment of a Lieutenant-Governor to Bengal enabled Dalhousie concentrate on administration.

His greatest achievement was the molding of the new provinces into a modern centralized state.
* For the newly acquired territories, he introduced the centralized control called “Non-Regulation System”.
* Under this system a Commissioner was appointed for a newly acquired territory.

Military reforms
* Dalhousie shifted the headquarters of Bengal Artillery from Calcutta to Meerut.
* Simla was made the permanent headquarters of the army.

### Railways
There were three major reasons for the British to take interest in the quick development of Railways:
* The first reason was commercial.
* The second main reason was administrative.
* The third reason was defense.

At the time of revolt and disturbance, movement of the forces was much easier through railways.
* The first railway line connecting Bombay with Thane was opened in 1853.
* Railway lines from Calcutta to the Raniganj coal-fields was opened in 1854
* Railway lines from Madras to Arakkonam was opened in 1856.

The first railway in the world was opened in 1825 in England.

### Telegraph
The use of Telegraph brought extraordinary changes in communication system.

In 1852, The main cities of the country viz., Calcutta, Peshawar, Bombay and Madras were telegraphically connected.

During the 1857 Revolt, the system of telegraphic communication proved a boon for the English and the military value of Dalhousie’s creation was much realized at that time.

### Postal Reform
The foundation of modern postal system was laid down by Lord Dalhousie.
* A new Post Office Act was passed in 1854.
* Consequently, irrespective of the distance over which the letter was sent, a uniform rate of half an _anna_ per post card was charged throughout India.
* Postage stamps were introduced for the first time.

### Education
* The educational Despatch of Sir Charles Wood (1854) was considered the “Intellectual Charter of India”.
* It provided an outline for the comprehensive scheme of education at primary, secondary and collegiate levels.
* Dalhousie fully accepted the views of Charles Wood and took steps to carry out the new scheme.
* The Universities of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras were founded in 1857, after Lord Dalhousie left India in 1856.

### Public Works Department
* Before the period of Dalhousie, the job of the Public Works Department was done by the Military Board.
* Dalhousie created a separate Public Works Department and allotted more funds for cutting canals and roads.
* By modernizing the Public Works Department he laid the foundations of the engineering service in India.

### Estimate of Dalhousie
