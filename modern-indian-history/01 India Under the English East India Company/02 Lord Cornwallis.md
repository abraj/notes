### Lord Cornwallis (1786-1793)

Lord Cornwallis:
* was a blue-blooded aristocrat and a warrior-statesman

#### Tipu Sultan and the Third Mysore War (1790-92)
The Treaty of Mangalore (1784) exhibited the military strength of Mysore, exposed English weaknesses and increased Tipu’s strength.

_Tipu Sultan:_
* Like his father he wanted to eliminate the English from India.
* He also wanted to take revenge against the Nizam and the Marathas as they had betrayed his father during the hour of need.
* strengthened his position by undertaking various internal reforms. This created worries to the British, the Nizam of Hyderabad and the Marathas.

Chief causes for the Third Mysore War:
* Tipu made attempts to seek the help of France and Turkey by sending envoys to those countries.
* He also expanded his territories at the cost of his neighbours, particularly the Raja of Travancore, who was an ally of the British.
* In 1789, the British concluded a tripartite alliance with the Nizam and the Marathas against Tipu.

Tipu Sultan had been defeated in the Third Mysore War and the strength of Mysore had been reduced. The British secured a large territory on the Malabar Coast. In addition they obtained the Baramahal district and Dindugal.

Tipu Sultan concluded the __Treaty of Srirangapattinam__ with the British in 1792.

The terms of the treaty were as follows:

#### Reforms of Lord Cornwallis

The internal reforms of Cornwallis can be studied under three main heads.
* Administrative reforms
* Revenue reforms or Permanent Settlement (given in Lesson 7??)
* Judicial and other reforms

#### Administrative Reforms

##### Purification of the civil service
Cornwallis found that:
* the servants of the Company were underpaid
* but they received very high commissions on revenues
* in addition to that, they conducted forbidden and profitable private trade in the names of relatives and friends

The greatest work of Cornwallis was the purification of the civil service by the employment of capable and honest public servants. Cornwallis, aimed at cleansing the administration.

* Cornwallis abolished the vicious system of paying small salaries and allowing enormous perquisites.
* He persuaded the Directors of the Company to pay handsome salaries to the Company servants in order that they might free themselves from commercial and corrupting activities.
* inaugurated the policy of making appointments mainly on the basis of merit thereby laying the foundation of the Indian Civil Service
* cut down on extravagances, he abolished a number of surplus posts


##### The separation of the three branches of service
* introduced was the separation of the three branches of service, namely commercial, judicial and revenue.
* the collectors, the king-pins of the administrative system were deprived of their judicial powers and their work became merely the collection of revenue

#### Judicial Reforms

Civil and criminal courts were completely reorganized.

* _'Sadar Diwani Adalat'_ (the highest civil court of appeal) and _'Sadar Nizamat Adalat'_ (the highest criminal court of appeal) at Calcutta were presided over by the Governor-General and his Council.
* There were four provincial courts of appeal at Calcutta, Dacca, Murshidabad and Patna, each under three European judges assisted by Indian advisers.
* As judicial powers of collectors were taken away, Every district was provided with a court. District and City courts functioned each under a European judge.
* Indian judges or Munsiffs were appointed to all the courts at the bottom of the judicial system.
* Hindu and Muslim laws were followed according to the religion of the litigants. In suits between Hindus and Muslims, the judge was the deciding authority.
* Cornwallis was merciful by temperament and abolished many barbarous punishments.
* In order to curb undue exercise of authority Cornwallis made all officials answerable to the courts.

Cornwallis prepared a comprehensive code, covering the whole field of administration’, judicial, police, commercial and fiscal. This Code was based upon the principle of Montesquieu, “the Separation of Powers”, which was popular in the West in 18th century.

#### Police Reforms
The effective implementation of judicial reforms required the reorganisation of police administration.

* The District Judge controlled the police.
* Each district was divided into _thanas_ or police circles each of which was about 20 square miles.
* It was placed under an Indian officer called the _daroga_ who was ably assisted by many constables.

However, the police organization was not effective. In the words of Joshua Marshman (a British Christian missionary), "the daroga enjoyed almost unlimited power of extortion and became the scourge of the country".

#### Other Reforms
* Cornwallis reformed the _'Board of Trade'_ which managed the commercial investments of the Company.
* He eradicated numerous abuses and corrupt practices.
* Fair treatment was given to weavers and Indian workers.
* He increased the remuneration for honest service.

#### Estimate of Cornwallis
* A new tradition of choosing a person from an aristocratic family for the post of Governor-General was initiated.
* He perceived the danger of Tipu’s growing power and curtailed it by boldly discarding the policy of nonintervention.
* He consolidated the Company’s position in India and started the tradition of efficient and pure administration.
* Although there were defects in his Permanent Settlement of Land Revenue, his administrative and judicial reforms were solid achievements.
* He may be regarded the parent of the Indian Administrative Service and founder of an efficient and clean system of administration.

Sir John Shore (1793-98) succeeded Cornwallis as Governor General and his administration was uneventful.
