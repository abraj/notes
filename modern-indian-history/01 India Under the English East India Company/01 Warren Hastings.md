#### Reforms of Warren Hastings

When Warren Hastings assumed the administration of Bengal in 1772, the financial position of the Company was very bad and the difficulties were intensified by the Great famine in Bengal of 1770.

1. Abolition of the Dual System
    - The East India Company decided to act as Diwan and to undertake the collection of revenue by its own agents.
    - Hence, the Dual System introduced by Robert Clive was abolished.

    - Each district was provided with a civil court under the Collector and a criminal court under an Indian Judge.
    - Experts in Hindu and Muslim laws to assist judges
    - To hear appeals from the district courts two appellate courts, one for civil cases and another for criminal cases, were established at Calcutta.
