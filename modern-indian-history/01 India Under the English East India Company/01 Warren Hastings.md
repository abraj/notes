## Warren Hastings (1772-1785)

### Reforms of Warren Hastings

When Warren Hastings assumed the administration of Bengal in 1772, the financial position of the Company was very bad and the difficulties were intensified by the Great famine in Bengal in 1770.

1. Abolition of the Dual System
    - The East India Company decided to act as Diwan and to undertake the collection of revenue by its own agents.
    - Hence, the Dual System introduced by Robert Clive was abolished.
    - stopped the annual payment given to the Mughal Emperor
2. Revenue Reforms
    - _Board of Revenue_ was established at Calcutta to supervise the collection of revenue
    - The treasury was removed from Murshidabad to Calcutta and an Accountant General was appointed.
    - Calcutta became the capital of Bengal in 1772
    - The system was a failure. Many zamindars defaulted and the arrears of revenue accumulated.
3. Reorganisation of the Judicial System
    - The Nawab and zamindars were highly corrupt and prejudiced.
    - Each district was provided with a civil court under the Collector and a criminal court under an Indian Judge.
    - Experts in Hindu and Muslim laws to assist judges
    - To hear appeals from the district courts two appellate courts, one for civil cases and another for criminal cases, were established at Calcutta.
        * The highest civil court of appeal was called _'Sadar Diwani Adalat'_
        * The highest appellate criminal court was known as _'Sadar Nizamat Adalat'_
4. Trade Regulations and other Reforms
    - Warren Hastings abolished the system of _'dastaks'_, or free passes and regulated the internal trade.
    - enforced a uniform tariff of 2.5 percent for Indian and non-Indian goods
    - introduced a uniform system of pre-paid postage system
    - A bank was started in Calcutta

### The Regulating Act of 1773

_Background:_
* The Home government in England consisted of the _Court of Directors_ and the _Court of Proprietors_.
* The Court of Directors were elected annually and practically managed the affairs of the Company.
* In India, each of the three presidencies was independent and responsible only to the Home Government. The government of the presidency was conducted by a Governor and a Council.
* The following conditions invited the Parliamentary intervention in the Company’s affairs:
    - Great famine in Bengal (1770)
    - --> poor revenue collection
    - --> East India Company on brink of Bankruptcy
    - --> 1773: East India Company approached British government for an immediate loan

Lord North, the Prime Minister of England, appointed a select committee to inquire into the affairs of the Company. The report submitted by the Committee paved the way for the enactment of the Regulating Act.

The Regulating Act reformed the Company’s Government at Home and in India.

_Provisions of the Act:_  
* The term of office of the members of the Court of Directors was extended from one year to four years. The retiring Directors were not eligible for re-election.
* The Governor of Bengal was styled the Governor-General of Fort William whose tenure of office was for a period of five years. So, Warren Hastings became the first Governor-General of Bengal in 1774.
* A council of four members was appointed to assist the Governor-General.
    - The government was to be conducted in accordance with the decision of the majority.
    - The Governor-General had a casting vote in case of a tie.
* The Governor-General in Council was made supreme over the other Presidencies in matters of war and peace.
* Provision was made in the Act for the establishment of a Supreme Court at Calcutta.
    - The Supreme Court was to be independent of the Governor-General in Council.
    - In 1774, the Supreme Court was established by a Royal Charter.
* This Act prevented all the servants of the Company from receiving directly or indirectly any gifts in kind or cash.

_Merits of the Act:_
* brought the affairs of the Company under the control of the Parliament
* proved that the Parliament of England was concerned about the welfare of Indians
* put an end to the arbitrary rule of the Company and provided a framework for all future enactments relating to the governing of India

_Demerits of the Act:_
* the Governor-General was made powerless because the council which was given supreme power
* frequent deadlocks on Governor-General's decision as a result of Council's over-ruling

However, many of these defects were rectified by the Pitt’s India Act of 1784.

### Pitt’s India Act, 1784
* In January 1784, Pitt the Younger (who later became the Prime Minister of England) introduced the 'India Bill' in the British Parliament.
* The bill was passed in the British Parliament and it received royal assent in August 1784.

_Provisions of the Act:_
* A Board of Control consisting of six members was created. They were appointed by the Crown.
* In England, The Court of Directors was retained without any alteration in its composition.
* In India, the number of members in the Governor-General’s Council was reduced from four to three. [4+1 --> 3+1]

Pitt’s India Act constitutes a significant landmark with regard to the foreign policy of the Company.
* The Court of Directors (who symbolised the Company) controlled its commercial functions.
* The Board of Control (who represented the King) maintained its political affairs.

### Expansionist Policy of Warren Hastings

#### The Rohilla War (1774)
* Rohilkand was a small kingdom situated in between Oudh and the Marathas. Its ruler was Hafiz Rahmat Khan.
* When Rahmat Khan evaded, the Nawab of Oudh with the help of the British invaded Rohilkand.
* Warren Hastings, who sent the British troops against Rohilkand was severely crticised for his policy on Rohilla affair.

#### The First Anglo-Maratha War (1775-82)
* The Marathas were largely remained disunited since the Third Battle of Panipat (1761).
* The internal conflict among the Marathas was best utilized by the British in their expansionist policy.

_Treaties signed:_
* 1776: Treaty of Purander
    - Warren Hastings cancelled the Treaty of Surat and concluded the Treaty of Purander with Nana Fadnavis.
    - Madhava Rao II was accepted as the new Peshwa
* 1782: Treaty of Salbai
    - Warren Hasting signed Treaty of Salbai with Mahadaji Scindia
    - Madhav Rao II was accepted as the Peshwa

_Significance of The Treaty of Salbai (1782):_
* The Treaty of Salbai established the British influence in Indian politics.
* It provided the British twenty years of peace with the Marathas.
* The Treaty also enabled the British to exert pressure on Mysore with the help of the Marathas in recovering their territories from Haider Ali.
* Thus, the British, on the one hand, saved themselves from the combined opposition of Indian powers and on the other, succeeded in dividing the Indian powers.

#### The Second Anglo-Mysore War (1780-84)
The first Anglo-Mysore War took place in 1767-69. Haider Ali emerged victorious against the British and at the end of the War a defensive treaty was concluded between Haider Ali
and the British. After eleven years, the Second Mysore War broke out.

_Main causes for the second Anglo-Mysore War were:_
* The British failed to fulfill the terms of the defensive treaty with Haider when he was attacked by the Marathas in 1771.
* There was an outbreak of hostilities between the English and the French (an ally of Haider) during the American War of Independence.
* The British captured Mahe, a French settlement within Haider’s territories.
* Haider Ali formed a grand alliance with the Nizam of Hyderabad and the Marathas against the British in 1779.

Warren Hastings, by a clever stroke of diplomacy, divided the Confederacy.
* he made peace with the Nizam of Hyderabad
* he came to an understanding with Marathas (Bhonsle and Scindia)

Consequently, Haider was isolated without any alliance.
* 1781: British defeated Haider Ali
* 1782: Haider Ali died of cancer

The Second Mysore War came to an end by the __Treaty of Mangalore__ in 1783.
