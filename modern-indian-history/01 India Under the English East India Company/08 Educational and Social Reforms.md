### Educational and Social Reforms

#### Language and Education Policy

_Prevalent state of education:_
* Although the British had captured Bengal in 1757, yet the responsibility of imparting education remained only in Indian hands.
* The study of ancient texts written in Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit still continued.
* state of oriental learning at the time of the establishment of the Company’s rule in Bengal
    - about 80,000 traditional institutions of learning in Bengal alone, which means that there was at least one institution for every four hundred people in that province.
    - Madras, Bombay and Punjab also demonstrate similar facts.
    - There was at least one school in every village of India at that time.

#### Education policy of The East India Company

The East India Company began to adopt a dual policy in the sphere of education.

* It discouraged the prevalent system of oriental education and gave importance to western education and English language.
* The Charter Act of 1813 adopted a provision to spend one lakh rupees per annum for the spread of education in India. The matter continued to generate debate for the next 20 years in in the British Parliament  and other spheres. Consequently, not even a single penny out of the allocated funds could be spent on education.

The contemporary British scholars were divided into two groups on the issue of development of education in India.
* The __Orientalists__ who advocated the promotion of oriental subjects through Indian languages.
* The __Anglicists__ who argued the cause of western sciences and literature in the medium of English language.

In 1829, after assuming the office of the Governor-General of India, Lord William Bentinck, emphasized on the medium of English language in Indian education.

__Macaulay's _'Minute on Indian Education'_:__

_Lord Macaulay:_
* Lord Macaulay, the Chairman of the General Committee of Public Instruction, played a major role in introducing English and western concepts to education in India.
* He supported the replacement of Persian by English as the official language, the use of English as the medium of instruction in all schools.
* In February 1835 Lord Macaulay announced his famous _"Macaulay Minute"_ advocating the Anglicist point of view.

Despite fierce opposition from all quarters, Lord William Bentinck got the resolution (regarding implementation of Macaulay's recommendations) passed on 7 March 1835 which declared that henceforth, government funds would be utilized for the promotion of western literature and science through the medium of English language.

__Wood's dispatch:__

In 1854, Sir Charles Wood sent a comprehensive dispatch as a grand plan on education.

_Recommendations:_
* The establishment of departments of public instructions in five provinces
* Introduction of the pattern of grants in aid to encourage private participation in the field of education
* laid emphasis on the establishment of schools for technical education, teacher and women education
* recommended the establishment of one University each in Calcutta, Bombay and Madras, on the model of the London University

Consequently, within the next few years, the Indian education became rapidly westernized.

#### Social Policies and Legislation

In the beginning, the British did not show any interest in taking the issue of social or religious reforms because:
* their interest was limited to trade and earning profits from economic exploitation
* they were apprehensive of interfering with the social and religious customs and institutions of the Indians because of the fear that they might lose trade advantage

Thus, they adopted the policy of extreme precaution and indifference towards social issues in India.

_Change in the British attitude of indifference towards social issues in India:_
* one reason why they indulged in criticizing the customs and traditions of India was to generate a feeling of inferiority complex among the Indians
* Social and religious movements in the mid-19th century against country’s social evils
* The propaganda carried out by the Christian missionaries also stirred the minds of the educated Indians.
* Impact of western thought and education and views expressed in different newspapers and magazines
* Personal interest in the matter shown by some of the British administrators like Lord William Bentinck

There were primarily two areas in which laws were enacted, laws pertaining to women emancipation and the caste system.
