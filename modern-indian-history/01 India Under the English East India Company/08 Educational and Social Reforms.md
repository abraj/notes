## Educational and Social Reforms

### Language and Education Policy

_Prevalent state of education:_
* Although the British had captured Bengal in 1757, yet the responsibility of imparting education remained only in Indian hands.
* The study of ancient texts written in Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit still continued.
* state of oriental learning at the time of the establishment of the Company’s rule in Bengal
    - about 80,000 traditional institutions of learning in Bengal alone, which means that there was at least one institution for every four hundred people in that province.
    - Madras, Bombay and Punjab also demonstrate similar facts.
    - There was at least one school in every village of India at that time.

### Education policy of The East India Company

The East India Company began to adopt a dual policy in the sphere of education.

* It discouraged the prevalent system of oriental education and gave importance to western education and English language.
* The Charter Act of 1813 adopted a provision to spend one lakh rupees per annum for the spread of education in India. The matter continued to generate debate for the next 20 years in in the British Parliament  and other spheres. Consequently, not even a single penny out of the allocated funds could be spent on education.

The contemporary British scholars were divided into two groups on the issue of development of education in India.
* The __Orientalists__ who advocated the promotion of oriental subjects through Indian languages.
* The __Anglicists__ who argued the cause of western sciences and literature in the medium of English language.

In 1829, after assuming the office of the Governor-General of India, Lord William Bentinck, emphasized on the medium of English language in Indian education.

__Macaulay's _'Minute on Indian Education'_:__

_Lord Macaulay:_
* Lord Macaulay, the Chairman of the General Committee of Public Instruction, played a major role in introducing English and western concepts to education in India.
* He supported the replacement of Persian by English as the official language, the use of English as the medium of instruction in all schools.
* In February 1835 Lord Macaulay announced his famous _"Macaulay Minute"_ advocating the Anglicist point of view.

Despite fierce opposition from all quarters, Lord William Bentinck got the resolution (regarding implementation of Macaulay's recommendations) passed on 7 March 1835 which declared that henceforth, government funds would be utilized for the promotion of western literature and science through the medium of English language.

__Wood's dispatch:__

In 1854, Sir Charles Wood sent a comprehensive dispatch as a grand plan on education.

_Recommendations:_
* The establishment of departments of public instructions in five provinces
* Introduction of the pattern of grants in aid to encourage private participation in the field of education
* laid emphasis on the establishment of schools for technical education, teacher and women education
* recommended the establishment of one University each in Calcutta, Bombay and Madras, on the model of the London University

Consequently, within the next few years, the Indian education became rapidly westernized.

### Social Policies and Legislation

In the beginning, the British did not show any interest in taking the issue of social or religious reforms because:
* their interest was limited to trade and earning profits from economic exploitation
* they were apprehensive of interfering with the social and religious customs and institutions of the Indians because of the fear that they might lose trade advantage

Thus, they adopted the policy of extreme precaution and indifference towards social issues in India.

_Change in the British attitude of indifference towards social issues in India:_
* one reason why they indulged in criticizing the customs and traditions of India was to generate a feeling of inferiority complex among the Indians
* Social and religious movements in the mid-19th century against country’s social evils
* The propaganda carried out by the Christian missionaries also stirred the minds of the educated Indians.
* Impact of western thought and education and views expressed in different newspapers and magazines
* Personal interest in the matter shown by some of the British administrators like Lord William Bentinck

There were primarily two areas pertaining to which laws were enacted:
* women emancipation
* caste system

## Social Laws Concerning Women
The condition of women, by the time the British established their rule, was not encouraging.

* Several evil practices such as the practice of Sati, the Purdah system, child marriage, female infanticide, bride price and polygamy had made their life quite miserable.
* The doors of education had been shut for them. The place of women had come to be confined to the four walls of her home.
* A Hindu woman was not entitled to inherit any property.

There was no social and economic equality between a man and woman. Thus, by and large, she was completely dependent on men.

During the 19th and 20th centuries some laws were enacted with the sincere efforts of social reformers, humanists and some British administrators to improve the condition of women in Indian society.

### Practice of _Sati_
* the enactment of law (Bengal Sati Regulation, 1829) against the practice of _Sati_ during the administration of Lord William Bentinck
* this was the first effort in the direction of improving the condition of women in Indian society

### Female Infanticide
It particularly prevailed in Rajputana, Punjab and the North Western Provinces.

_Major reasons responsible for this practice:_
* family pride
* the fear of not finding a suitable match for the girl child
* the hesitation to bend before the prospective in-laws

Some laws were enacted against this practice in 1795, 1802 and 1804 and then in 1870. However, the practice could not be completely eradicated only through legal measures. Gradually, this evil practice came to be done away through education and public opinion.

### Widow Remarriage

There are many historical evidences to suggest that widow remarriage enjoyed social sanction during ancient period in India. In course of time the practice ceased to prevail.

Social reformers (Prominently Raja Rammohan Roy and Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar) made sincere efforts to popularize widow remarriage by:
* writing in newspapers and contemporary journals
* carrying out large scale campaigns in this regard mainly through books, pamphlets and petitions

The __Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act, 1856__ legalised the remarriage of Hindu widows in all jurisdictions of India under East India Company rule.

### Child Marriage
* In November 1870, the Indian Reforms Association was started with the efforts of Keshav Chandra Sen.
* A journal called _'Mahapap Bal Vivah'_ (Child marriage: The Cardinal Sin) was also launched with the efforts of B.M. Malabari to fight against child marriage.
* In 1846, the minimum marriageable age for a girl was only 10 years.
* In 1891, through the enactment of the _Age of Consent Act_, this was raised to 12 years.
* In 1930, through the _Sharda Act_, the minimum age was raised to 14 years.
* After independence, the limit was raised to 18 years in 1978.

### Purdah System
* The condition of women among the peasantry was relatively better in this respect.
* Purdah was not so much prevalent in Southern India.

Through the large scale participation of women in the national freedom movement, the system disappeared without any specific legislative measure taken against it.

### Struggle against the Caste System

* The caste system was primarily based on the fourfold division of society viz. Brahmins, Kshatriya, Vaishyas and Shudras.
* Shudras, on account of their lower social status, were subjected to all kinds of social discrimination.
* In the beginning of the 19th century the castes of India had been split into innumerable sub-castes on the basis of birth.

__Untouchability :__  

Abolition of untouchability became a major issue of the 19th century social and religious reform movements in the country.

* Mahatma Gandhi
    - he made the removal of untouchability a part of his constructive programme
    - He brought out a paper, _The Harijan_, and also organised the Harijan Sevak Sangh.
* Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar
    - he dedicated his entire life for the welfare of the downtrodden
    - In Bombay, he formed a Bahiskrit Hitkarini Sabha in July 1924 for this purpose.
    - Later, he also organised the Akhil Bharatiya Dalit Varg Sabha to fight against caste oppression.
* Jyotirao Phule and Shri Narayana Guru
    - they established societies to include self-esteem among the downtrodden
    - Jyotirao Phule in Western India established the 'Satya Sadhak Samaj'
    - Shri Narayana Guru in Kerala established the 'Shri Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam' (SNDP)
* Periyar E.V.R.
    - 'Self-respect Movement' in the beginning of 20th century  in the Madras Presidency

There were many other individual and institutional efforts directed mainly towards removing the disabilities suffered by Harijans in regard to:
- drawing of water from public wells
- getting entry into temples
- admission into schools
