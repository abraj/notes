#### Charter Act of 1833

The Regulating Act of 1773 made it compulsory to renew the Company’s Charter after twenty years.

Hence, the Charter Act of 1793 was passed by the Parliament. It extended the life of Company for another twenty years and introduced minor changes in the existing set up.

The Charter Act of 1813 provided one lakh of rupees annually for the promotion of Indian education. It also extended the Company’s charter for another twenty years.

The Charter Act of 1833 was a significant constitutional instrument defining the scope and authority of the East India Company. The liberal and utilitarian __philosophy of Bentham__ was made popular by the provisions of this Act.

_Important provisions of The Charter Act of 1833:_
* The English East India Company ceased to be a commercial agency in India. In other words, it would function hereafter as the political agent for the Crown.
* The trade monopoly acquired by the English East India Company was ended by the Charter Act of 1833.
* The Governor-General of Fort William was hereafter called ‘the Governor- General of India’. Thus, Bentinck was the first Governor-General of India’.
* A Law Member was appointed to the Governor-General’s Council. T. B. Macaulay was the first Law Member of the Governor-General's Council.
* The Act categorically stated ‘that no native of India, nor any natural born subject of His Majesty, should be disabled from holding any place, office, or employment, by reason of his religion, place of birth, descent or colour”. It was this enactment which laid the foundation for the Indianisation of public services.

After twenty years, the Charter Act of 1853 was passed and it was the last in the series of Charter Acts.

#### Reforms of Lord William Bentinck
Although his tenure of office covered only a short span of seven years, it saw a period of enduring reforms.

__Financial Reforms :__  
When Bentinck assumed the Governor-Generalship in 1828, the financial position of the Company was poor.

* He reduced the salaries and allowances of all officers and additional staff were removed.
* In the military department, he abolished the system of double _batta_. (_Batta_ was an allowance to troops on active service.)


__Administrative Reforms :__
* In the judicial department he abolished the provincial courts of appeal established by Cornwallis. They were largely responsible for the huge arrears of cases.
* He introduced local languages in the lower courts and English in the higher courts in the place of Persian.
* He launched the revenue settlements of the North West Province. This settlement was for a period of 30 years and it was made either with the tillers of the soil, or with the landowners.

__Social Reforms :__  
The social reforms of William Bentinck made his name immortal in the history of British India. These include the abolition of _Sati_, the suppression of Thugs and the prevention of female infanticide.

* Abolition of Sati
    - The practice of _sati_, the age old custom of burning of widows alive on the funeral pyre of their husbands was prevalent in India from ancient times.
    - He promulgated his Regulation XVII on 4 December 1829 prohibiting the practice of _sati_ (in Bengal).
    - Those who practiced _sati_ were made liable for punishment by law courts as accessories to the crime.
    - The Regulation was extended to the Madras and Bombay Presidencies in 1830.
* Suppression of Thugs
    - Thugs were hereditary robbers. They went about in small groups of fifty to hundred posing as commercial gangs or pilgrims ‘strangling and robbing peaceful travellers’. They increased in number in central and northern India during the 18th century when anarchy reigned after the disintegration of the Mughal Empire.
    - A campaign was systematically organised by Colonel Sleeman from 1830 against the thugs. During the course of five years nearly 2000 of them were captured. A greater number of them were exterminated and the rest were transported to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
    - For his role in the suppression of thugs, Sir William Sleeman was known as “Thugee Sleeman”.
* Prevention of female infanticide
    - The practice killing female infants was very much prevalent in places like Rajputana, Punjab, Malwa and Cutch.
    - He not only prohibited female infanticide but declared them as punishable crime.
    - Bentinck took effective steps to prevent the ritual of child sacrifice.

__Educational Reforms :__

* Introduction of English Education
    - He appointed a committee headed by Lord Macaulay to make recommendations for the promotion of education.
    - In his report, Macaulay emphasized the promotion of European literature and science through English medium to the people of India. This recommendation was wholeheartedly accepted by William Bentinck.
    - The Government Resolution in 1835 made English the official and literary language of India.
* In 1835, William Bentinck laid foundation of the Calcutta Medical College.

#### Estimate of William Bentinck
* Bentinck was a “straightforward, honest, upright, benevolent, sensible man”.
* His social reforms such as abolition of _sati_ and prevention of child sacrifice eradicated age old evils from Hindu society.
* He had courage and straightforwardness. To enforce the regulations regarding the prohibition of _sati_, he was prepared to risk his own position.
* His educational reforms heralded a new age in India.
