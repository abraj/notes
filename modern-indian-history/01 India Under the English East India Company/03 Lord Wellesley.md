### Lord Wellesley (1798-1805)

Richard Colley Wellesley was a great imperialist and called himself ‘a Bengal tiger’.

Wellesley came to India with a determination to launch a forward policy in order to make ‘the British Empire in India’ into ‘the British Empire of India’.

The system that he adopted to achieve his object is known as the ‘Subsidiary Alliance’.

Preservation of British prestige and removal of French danger from India were Wellesley’s twin aims.


#### Political Condition of India at the time of Wellesley’s Arrival
* In the north-western India, the danger of Zaman Shah’s aggression posed a serious threat to the British power in India.
* In the north and central India, the Marathas remained a formidable political power.
* The Nizam of Hyderabad employed the Frenchmen to train his army.
* The political unrest in the Karnatak region continued and Tipu Sultan had remained the uncompromising enemy of the British.
* The policy of neutrality adopted by Sir John Shore, the successor of Cornwallis, created a kind of political unrest in India and greatly affected the prestige of the English. His non-intervention policy contributed much to the growth of anti-British feelings.
* Further, Napoleon’s move for an Eastern invasion created a fear among English statesmen.

#### The Subsidiary Alliance System

Lord Wellesley reversed the non-intervention policy of his predecessor and formulated his master plan namely the ‘Subsidiary Alliance’. Wellesley enlarged and consolidated the already existing system. However, his originality was revealed in its application.

_Main Features of Subsidiary Alliance:_
* Any Indian ruler who entered into the subsidiary alliance with the British had to maintain a contingent of British troops in his territory.
* It was commanded by a British officer. The Indian state was called __‘the protected state’__ and the British hereinafter were referred to as __‘the paramount power’__.
* It was the duty of the British to safeguard that state from external aggression and to help its ruler maintain internal peace. The protected state should give some money or give part of its territory to the British to support the subsidiary force.
* The protected state should cut off its connection with European powers other than the English and with the French in particular. The state was also forbidden to have any political contact even with other Indian powers without the permission of the British.
* The ruler of the protected state should keep a British Resident at his court and disband his own army. He should not employ Europeans in his service without the sanction of the paramount power.
* The paramount power should not interfere in the internal affairs of the protected state.

_Significance of Subsidiary Alliance:_

Wellesley’s Subsidiary System is regarded as one of the master-strokes of British imperialism. His diplomacy made the British the paramount power in India.

* It increased the military strength of the Company in India at the expense of the protected states.
* The territories of the Company were free from the ravages of war thereby establishing the stability of the British power in India.
* The position of the British was strengthened against its Indian and non-Indian enemies.

_Defects of the Subsidiary System:_
* establishment of subsidiary forces introduced anarchy because of the unemployment of thousands of soldiers sent away by the Indian princes
* robbery activities of disbanded soldiers were felt much in central India where the menace of Pindaris affected the people
* Safeguarded against external danger and internal revolt, the princes of the protected states neglected their administrative responsibilities. They preferred to lead easy-going and pleasure-seeking lives. As a result misgovernment followed.
* In course of time, the anarchy and misrule in several states had resulted in their annexation by the British.
* the British collected very heavy subsidies from the protected princes and this had adversely affected their economy

_Enforcement of the Subsidiary System:_
* Hyderabad (1798)
    - the first state which was brought under Wellesley’s Subsidiary System in 1798
* Tanjore (1799)
    - The Maratha state of Tanjore witnessed a succession dispute. In 1799, Wellesley concluded a treaty with Sarabhoji (Serfoji II).
    - In accordance with this treaty the British took over the administration of the state and allowed Serfoji to retain the title of Raja with a pension.
* Surat (1799)
    - The Nawab of this historic city died in 1799 and his brother succeeded him.
    - The change of succession provided Wellesley an opportunity to take over the administration of Surat.
* Karnatak (1801)
    - The Nawab died in the middle of 1801 and his son, Ali Hussain became the Nawab. Wellesley asked him to retire with a liberal pension leaving the administration to the English.
    - Since he refused, Wellesley signed a treaty with Azim-ud daulah, the nephew of the deceased Nawab in 1801.
    - Accordingly the entire military and civil administration of the Karnatak came under the British.
* Oudh (1801)
    - The threat of invasion by Zaman Shah of Afghanistan was the pretext for Wellesley to force the Nawab of Oudh to enter into a subsidiary treaty in 1801 (Treaty of Lucknow).
    - Accordingly, the Nawab gave the British the rich lands of Rohilkhand, the lower Doab and Gorakhpur for the maintenance of an increased army which the British stationed in the capital of Oudh.
    - For the maintenance of law and order the British were authorised to frame rules and regulations. By this, the British acquired the right to interfere in the internal matters of Oudh.

#### The Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1799)

_The circumstances and strategy of Tipu Sultan:_
* Tipu Sultan wanted to avenge his humiliating defeat and the terms imposed on him by the British.
* He also aimed at making Mysore a strong state.
* He sought the help of France, Arabia, Kabul and Turkey to fight British imperialism. Also, he had friendly relations with Napoleon.
* He corresponded with the Revolutionary French Government in July 1798. At Srirangapattinam, flag of the French Republic was hoisted. The tree of Liberty was also planted.

_Strategy of Wellesley:_
* Wellesley reached Calcutta with a mind already filled with fear of Napoleon. Therefore, he prepared for a war against Mysore.
* Wellesley tried to revive the Triple Alliance of 1790 with the Marathas. Though his proposal was not accepted by the Marathas, they promised to remain neutral.
* A Subsidiary Alliance with the Nizam of Hyderabad was concluded by the British and as a consequence, the French force at Hyderabad was disbanded.
* Wellesley tried to persuade Tipu to accept a pact of subsidiary alliance and wrote letters requesting the Tipu to dismiss the French, to receive an English envoy. Tipu paid no attention to Wellesley’s letters and thus the Fourth Anglo-Mysore war started.

The war was short and decisive. Although severely wounded, Tipu fought till his capital Srirangapattinam was captured and he himself was shot dead.

_Mysore After the War:_
* With the fall of Tipu Sultan the kingdom of Mysore fell at the feet of Wellesley.
* He restored Hindu rule at the central part of the kingdom.
* A five year old boy, Krishnaraja III, a descendant of the dethroned Hindu Raja, was enthroned at Mysore, which became the capital almost after two hundred years.
* Purnaiya, the previous minister, became _Diwan_. A British Resident was stationed at Mysore.
* Tipu’s family was sent to the fort of Vellore.
* The remaining parts of the kingdom were divided between the British and the Nizam.

#### Wellesley and the Marathas

The only power that remained outside the purview of the subsidiary system was the Marathas.

_Nana Fadnavis:_
* Nana Fadnavis provided the leadership to the Marathas at the time of Wellesley.
* By extending a helping hand to Cornwallis against Tipu he was able to acquire a large slice of territory as the share of the Marathas from the kingdom of Mysore.
* His death in 1800 removed the last great Maratha leader.

_Peshwa Baji Rao II:_
* Peshwa Baji Rao II, despite his stately appearance and immense learning, lacked political wisdom.
* The internal conflict among the Maratha leaders proved to be self-destructive.
    - Jaswant Rao Holkar (Holkar dynasty of the Marathas) and Daulat Rao Scindia (Gwaliar state within the Maratha Confederacy) were fighting against each other. The Peshwa supported Scindia against Holkar.
    - Holkar marched against the Peshwa. The combined forces of Scindia and the Peshwa were utterly defeated.
    - The city of Poona fell into the hands of Holkar.
* Peshwa Baji Rao II was in great danger, so he fled to Bassein where he signed the _'Treaty of Bassein'_ with the British in 1802. It was a subsidiary treaty and the Peshwa was recognized as the head of the Maratha kingdom. This treaty was considered the crowning triumph of Wellesley’s Subsidiary System.
* Immediately after Treaty of Bassein, the British troops marched under the command of Governor-General’s brother, Arthur Wellesley towards Poona and restored the Peshwa to his position. The forces of Holkar vanished from the Maratha capital.
* Marathas considered this treaty as a document of surrendering their independence. In accordance with this document, the foreign policy of the Marathas came under British control and therefore any action of the Maratha chiefs against the British was successfully prevented.

#### The Second Maratha War (1803-1805)

_Scindia and Bhonsle:_
* Daulat Rao Scindia and Raghoji Bhonsle took the Treaty of Bassein as an insult to the national honour of the Marathas.
* Soon the forces of both the chieftains were united and they crossed the river Narmada. Wellesley seized this opportunity and declared war in August 1803. British forces captured Ahmadnagar. The combined forces of Scindia and Bhonsle were defeated near Aurangabad.
* Subsequently, Arthur Wellesley carried the war into Bhonsle’s territory and completely defeated the Maratha forces on the plains of Argaon.
* As a result, the __Treaty of Deogaon__ was signed between Bhonsle and Wellesley. The former signed the subsidiary treaty which forced him to give up the province of Cuttack in Orissa.
* Scindia signed a subsidiary treaty with the British. It is known as the __Treaty of Surji–Arjungaon__.

_Holkar:_
* During the war against Bhonsle and Scindia, Holkar remained aloof because he was Scindia’s enemy.
* However, when Wellesley offered an alliance, Holkar made extreme demands. This made Wellesley to declare war against Holkar.
* The campaign against Holkar was well-organised but the English generals for the first time committed blunders. Holkar remained unsubdued.

#### Estimate of Wellesley
* An unscrupulous annexationist and an advocate of forward policy
* He converted 'the British Empire in India' to 'the British Empire of India'. He turned the East India Company from a trading corporation into an imperial power.
* He located the weak spots of the Indian powers and applied his political technique (namely Subsidiary Alliance).
* y the annexation of Karnatak and Tanjore he paved the way for the formation of the Madras Presidency. He rightly deserves to be called the maker of the erstwhile Madras Presidency and the creator of the Province of Agra.
