#### Khilafat Movement
* The chief cause of the Khilafat Movement was the defeat of Turkey in the First World War.
* The harsh terms of the Treaty of Sevres (1920) was felt by the Muslims as a great insult to them.
* The whole movement was based on the Muslim belief that the Caliph (the Sultan of Turkey) was the religious head of the Muslims all over the world.
* The Muslims in India were upset over the British attitude against Turkey and launched the Khilafat Movement.

Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, M.A. Ansari, Saifuddin Kitchlew and the Ali brothers were the prominent leaders of this movement.

Mahatma Gandhi was particularly interested in bringing the Hindus and the Muslims together to achieve the countryâ€™s independence. Subsequently, the Khilafat Movement merged with the Non-Cooperation Movement launched by Mahatma Gandhi in 1920.

#### Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-1922)
The programmes of the Non-Cooperation Movement were:
* Surrender of titles and honorary positions.
* Resignation of membership from the local bodies.
