### The Second World War and National Movement

* In 1937 elections were held under the provisions of the Government of India Act of 1935. Congress Ministries were formed in seven states of India.
* On 1 September 1939 the Second World War broke out. The British Government without consulting the people of India involved the country in the war.
* The Congress vehemently opposed it and as a mark of protest the Congress Ministries in the Provinces resigned on 22 December 1939.
* The Muslim League celebrated that day (22 December 1939) as the Deliverance Day, intended to celebrate the resignation of all members of the rival Congress party from provincial and central offices.
* In March 1940 the Muslim League demanded the creation of Pakistan.

#### August Offer
* announced by British Government on 8 August 1940
* for securing the cooperation of the Indians
* envisaged that after the War a representative body of Indians would be set up to frame the new Constitution
* Gandhi was not satisfied with is offer and decided to launch 'Individual Satyagraha'.

#### Individual Satyagraha
* limited, symbolic and non-violent in nature
* left to Mahatma Gandhi to choose the _Satyagrahis_
* Acharya Vinoba Bhave was the first to offer Satyagraha and he was sentenced to three months imprisonment.
* Jawaharlal Nehru was the second Satyagrahi and imprisoned for four months.
* The individual Satyagraha continued for nearly 15 months.

#### Cripps Mission (1942)
British Government's continued effort to secure Indian cooperation during the war.  

The main recommendations of Sir Stafford Cripps were:
* The promise of Dominion Status to India
* Protection of minorities
* setting up of a Constituent Assembly in which there would be representatives from the Princely States along with those of the British Provinces,
* There would be provision for any Province of British India not prepared to accept this Constitution, either to retain its present constitutional position or frame a constitution of its own.

_Reaction of Indians:_
* The major political parties of the country rejected the Cripps proposals.
* Gandhi called Cripp’s proposals as a “Post-dated Cheque”.
* They did not like the rights of the Princely States either to send their representatives to the Constituent Assembly or to stay out of the Indian Union.
* The Muslim League was also dissatisfied as its demand for Pakistan had not been conceded in the proposal.

#### Quit India Movement (1942-1944)

The failure of the Cripps Mission and the fear of an impending Japanese invasion of India led Mahatma Gandhi to begin his campaign for the British to quit India.

The All India Congress Committee met at Bombay on 8 August 1942 and passed the famous 'Quit India Resolution'. On the same day, Gandhi gave his call of ‘do or die’.

_British response:_
* On 8th and 9th August 1942, the government arrested all the promin- ent leaders of the Congress. This left the Indian people without leadership.
* Mahatma Gandhi was kept in prison at Poona. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Abul Kalam Azad, and other leaders were imprisoned in the Ahmednagar Fort.

_Course of the Movement:_
* At this time, leadership was provided by Ram Manohar Lohia, Achyuta and S.M. Joshi. The role of Jayaprakash Narain in this movement was important.
* Large number of students also left their schools and colleges to join the movement. The youth of the nation also participated in this movement with patriotism.
* Strikes, demonstrations and public meetings were organised in various towns and cities. Slowly the movement reached the rural areas.
* In 1943, as the movement gained further momentum, there were armed attacks on government buildings in Madras and Bengal.
* In 1944 Mahatma Gandhi was released from jail.
* Nearly 60,229 persons were jailed. At least 7,000 people were killed.

_Significance of the Movement:_
* This movement paved the way for India’s freedom.
* It aroused among Indians the feelings of bravery, enthusiasm and total sacrifice.

#### Indian National Army
During the course of the Second World War, armed revolutionary activities continued to take place.

* On 2 July 1943, Subhas Chandra Bose reached Singapore and gave the rousing war cry of ‘Dilli Chalo’.
* He was made the President of Indian Independence League and soon became the supreme commander of the Indian National Army.
* He gave the country the slogan of 'Jai Hind'.
* The names of the INA’s three Brigades were the Subhas Brigade, Gandhi Brigade and Nehru Brigade. The women’s wing of the army was named after Rani Laxmibai.

The Indian National Army marched towards Imphal after registering its victory over Kohima. After Japan’s surrender in 1945 the INA failed in its efforts. 

Under such circumstances, Subhas went to Taiwan. Then on his way to Tokyo he died on 18 August 1945 in a plane crash.
