### Lord Ripon (1880-84)

#### The Afghan policy
* Ripon was instructed to reverse the Afghan policy of Lytton.
* Therefore, as soon as he came to India, peace was made with Afghanistan without affecting the British prestige.
* The proposal of appointing a Resident in Kabul was dropped.

#### Introduction of Local Self-Government (1882)
This was his most important achievement. It was Ripon who laid the foundations of the system which functions today.
* Ripon helped the growth of local bodies like the Municipal Committees in towns and the local boards in taluks and villages.
* The powers of municipalities were increased. Their chairmen were to be non-officials. They were entrusted the care of local amenities, sanitation, drainage and water-supply and also primary education.
* District and taluk boards were created. It was insisted that the majority of the members of these boards should be elected non-officials.
* The local bodies were given executive powers with financial resources of their own.
* He also insisted on the election of local bodies as against selection by the government.

#### Educational Reforms
* Ripon wanted to review the working of the educational system on the basis of the recommendations of the Wood’s Despatch.
* appointed William Hunter Commission in 1882 for further improvement of the system
* Hunter Commission recommendations:
    - the expansion and improvement of the elementary education of the masses
    - two channels for the secondary education-one was literary education leading up to the Entrance Examination of the university and the other preparing the students for a vocational career
    - encouraged the local bodies in the villages and towns to manage the elementary education

#### First Factory Act (1881)
Introduced to improve the service condition of the factory workers in India
* banned the appointment of children below the age of seven in factories
* reduced the working hours for children
* made compulsory for all dangerous machines in the factories to be properly fenced to ensure security to the workers

#### Ilbert Bill Agitation (1884)

According to the system of law, a European could be tried only by a European Judge or a European Magistrate.  
C.P. Ilbert, Law Member, introduced a bill in 1883 to abolish this discrimination (racial distinction) in judiciary.  
* Europeans opposed this Bill strongly
* The press in England joined the issue.
* Hence, Ripon amended the bill to satisfy the English in India and England.

_Effects of The Ilbert Bill controversy:_
* Ripon was totally disillusioned and heartbroken and he tendered his resignation and left for England.
* helped the cause of Indian nationalism
* The immediate result of this awakening of India was the birth of the Indian National Congress in 1885, the very next year of Ripon’s departure.

#### Other reforms
* repealed the Vernacular Press Act
* the rendition of Mysore to its Hindu ruler

#### Estimate of Lord Ripon
* Lord Ripon was the most popular Viceroy that England ever sent to India.
* The Indians by and large hailed him as “Ripon the Good”, because he was the only Viceroy who handled the Indian problems with compassion and sympathy.
* devoted himself to task of liberalising the Indian administration.
