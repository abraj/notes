### Swami Dayanand Saraswathi and the Arya Samaj

Swami Dayanand (1824-83) founded Arya Samaj at Bombay in 1875. Swami Dayanand believed the Vedas were the source of true knowledge. His motto was “Back to the Vedas”.

* He was against idol worship, child marriage and caste system based on birth.
* He encouraged inter- caste marriages and widow remarriage.
* He started the Suddhi movement to bring back those Hindus who had converted to other religions to its fold.

He wrote the book _'Satyartha Prakash'_ which contains his ideas.

The first Dayanand Anglo-Vedic (DAV) School was founded in 1886 at Lahore. Many more schools came up in other parts of India in later years.

The Arya Samaj had also spread nationalism. Hundreds of Arya Samaj patriots, including Lala Lajpat Rai, took part in the Indian freedom struggle.
