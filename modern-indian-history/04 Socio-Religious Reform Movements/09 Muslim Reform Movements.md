### Muslim Reform Movements

The Muslim reform movements started a little later because they had avoided western education in the beginning.

#### Muhammad Literary Society
* The first effort was in 1863 when the Muhammad Literary Society was set up in Calcutta.
* Its aim was to popularise the study of English and western sciences.
* It established a number of schools in Bengal.

#### Sir Syed Ahmad Khan and Aligarh Movement

Sir Syed Ahmad Khan (1817-98) started the Aligarh Movement for the social and educational advancement of the Muslims in India.

* He fought against the medieval backwardness and advocated a rational approach towards religion.
* In 1866, he started the Mohammadan Educational Conference as a general forum for spreading liberal ideas among the Muslims.
* In 1875, he founded a modern school at Aligarh to promote English education among the Muslims. This had later grown into the Mohammadan Anglo Oriental College and then into the Aligarh Muslim University.

#### Deoband Movement
The orthodox section among the Muslim ulema organised the Deoband Movement.

It was a revivalist movement whose twin objectives were:
1. to propagate among the Muslims the pure teachings of the Koran and the Hadis and
2. to keep alive the spirit of jihad aganist the foreign rulers.

The new Deoband leader Mahmud-ul-Hasan (1851-1920) sought to impart a political and intellectual content to the religious ideas of the school. The liberal interpretation of Islam created a political awakening among its followers.
