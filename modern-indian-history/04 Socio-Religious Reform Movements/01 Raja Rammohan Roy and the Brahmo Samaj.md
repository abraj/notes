Raja Rammohan Roy (1772-1833) established the Brahmo Samaj at Calcutta in 1828 in order to purify Hinduism and to preach monotheism (existence of only one God). He combined the teachings of the Upanishads, the Bible and the Koran in developing unity among the people of different religions. He is considered as the first ‘modern man of India’.
